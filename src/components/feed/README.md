- `addComment()` - Add new comments/replies
- `updateComment()` - Edit comments
- `deleteComment()` - Soft delete comments

### `UsersService`
- `getCurrentUser()` - Get authenticated user
- `getUserById()` - Get user profiles
- `toggleFollowUser()` - Follow/unfollow users

## Features

## Usage

### Basic Feed Implementation
```tsx
import { Feed } from '@/components/feed';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Feed 
      initialPosts={serverPosts} 
      currentUserId={user.id} 
    />
  );
}
```

### Individual Components
```tsx
import { PostCard, CommentSection } from '@/components/feed';

// Individual post display
<PostCard 
  post={post} 
  currentUserId={userId}
  onPostUpdate={handleUpdate}
/>

// Comments for a specific post
<CommentSection 
  postId={postId}
  currentUserId={userId}
  onCommentCountUpdate={handleCommentUpdate}
/>
```

## Database Schema

The feed system uses these main tables:
- `posts` - Post content and metadata
- `post_likes` - Like/reaction tracking
- `post_comments` - Threaded comments
- `follows` - User relationships for feed filtering
- `users` - User profiles and authentication

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Server-side rendering for initial posts
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Image lazy loading with Next.js
- Pagination for large feeds

### Recommended Optimizations
- Implement virtual scrolling for very large feeds
- Add image optimization and CDN integration
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement feed pre-generation for popular content

## Security

### Implemented Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Content validation and sanitization
- User authentication checks
- Proper error handling without data exposure

### Additional Security Recommendations
- Content moderation system
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Input validation on all user content
- Abuse reporting functionality

## Testing

### Test Files
- `__tests__/services.test.ts` - Service integration tests
- Manual testing functions for development

### Recommended Testing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full feed flow
- E2E tests for user interactions
- Performance testing for large datasets

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Any Cloudinary keys for media upload

### Database Requirements
- All migration files applied
- RLS policies enabled
- Database functions deployed
- Proper indexing for performance
